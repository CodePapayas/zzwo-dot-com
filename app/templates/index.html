                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <h3>I'm Zach.</h3> 
                <p>I live in the Pacific Northwest and work in the behavioral 
                   health industry protecting and connecting sensitive data.
                </p>
                <p>My work, ranging from production healthcare tools to 
                   open-source contributions, is centered on solving real-world problems 
                   for my community and beyond. Safely transmitting and storing your 
                   sensitive data is my first and main goal, and this mission has only 
                   grown more important as technology progresses down the unpredictable 
                   path it always takes. Always open to discussion and collaboration.

                        <h3>Pond Spawn</h3>
                        <p>Artificial life simulation where agents with unique neural
                            network brains evolve through genetic mutation. Each agent
                            perceives its environment, makes decisions via a feedforward
                            network (5→8→8→8→6), and passes mutated genomes to offspring.
                            Built with Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pygame, and Matplotlib.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is an ongoing project. I use this as a sort of sandbox
                            for a prototyping ideas and testing out configurations. The most 
                            rewarding part of this has been my increased understanding of neural 
                            networks. I find it refreshing to be able to talk about convoluted 
                            neural networks and actually know what I'm talking about.</p>

                        <h3>Pylint (Open Source Contributor)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Contributed to the core static analysis engine of Pylint
                            to improve inference accuracy. Engineered logic to correctly
                            handle the control flow of
                            <code>unittest.TestCase.fail()</code>, preventing
                            false-positive 'used-before-assignment' errors. Additionally,
                            refined the inference of <code>pathlib.Path</code> objects
                            to ensure Pylint correctly identifies attributes on joined
                            paths.
                        </p>
                        <p>What began as a class assignment wound up being an intense interest. 
                            Contributing to Pylint was very fun. Writing code is very rewarding, 
                            and systems design is great when you can build from scratch. However, 
                            reading and understanding a mature codebase is equally satisfying while 
                            being far less common work for me to encounter. In reviewing the Pylint 
                            control flow I gained some confidence in myself as a coder that I may have 
                            been lacking up to this point. Extremely friendly community and maintainers. 
                            If anyone is curious about contributing to an OSS project, there are worse 
                            repos to try it with.
